and Vickers Ltd. This provided for the construction of these two ships, one  
to be built at Barrow-in-Furness and the second at Rio Santiago with  
British assistance and overseeing. Santisima Trinidad was sabotaged on 22  
August 1975 whilst fitting-out and subsequently placed in floating-dock at  
AFNE. Began trials early 1981.  
STRUCTURE     : Pennant numbers are displayed without the D prefix.  
OPERATIONAL   : Although laid up for some time between 1983 and 1986 both  
ships were at sea for short periods in 1987 and back with the Fleet in  
1988.  
OPINION       : Although both were at sea in 1989 it is unlikely that the Sea  
Dart system is operational.

sold to the South African Navy in 1976 while under construction. As a  
result of a UN embargo on arms sales to South Africa this sale was  
cancelled. Purchased by Argentina in autumn 1978. Both arrived in Argentina  
2 November 1978 (third ship being ordered some time later) and all have  
proved very popular ships in the Argentine Navy.  
MODERNISATION : Drummond has had her armament updated to the same standard  
as the other two, replacing the Bofors 40/60.  
OPERATIONAL   : Endurance, 15 days. Very economical in fuel consumption.

PROGRAMMES    : Contract signed on 2 June 1987 for construction of six Swedish  
designed Kockums Type 471 with a possibility of two more in due course.  
Builders, Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC) with shipyard at Adelaide.  
Fabrication work started in June 1989 with the first of class in service in  
1995; bow and stern sections of the first submarine are being built in  
Sweden. The option on the two additional boats has been recommended by the  
Navy and a decision is required by June 1990.  
STRUCTURE     : Stirling engines remain a possibility for later submarines of  
the class. Scylla is an updated Eledone sonar suite. Diving depth, 300 m  
(985 ft).  
OPERATIONAL   : Plans are to base four at HMAS Stirling, WA, and the  
remaining two at HMAS Platypus, Sydney.  
OPINION       : This is a high risk project using an unproven design from a  
shipyard unfamiliar with either oceanic or tropical submarine operating  
conditions. A marvellous opportunity for the Australian shipbuilding  
industry.

class to be built in British shipyards. Subsequently two more were ordered  
in October 1971 for delivery in 1975-76 later extended to 1977-78.  
MODERNISATION : Between October 1977 and October 1985 all submarines of the  
class were given a mid-life modernisation at Vickers, Cockatoo. Trials on  
one submarine for the Kariwara towed array but this is not yet an  
operational system and may not be until 1994. Sub Harpoon fitted in  
1985-86. The two short stern tubes have been removed.  
OPERATIONAL   : 1st Submarine Squadron is based at HMAS Platypus, Neutral  
Bay, Sydney. One submarine is based at HMAS Stirling in Western Australia.

data system and modern radars. Hobart and Brisbane were brought to the same  
standard in 1978 and 1979 at the Garden Island Dockyard in Sydney. A second  
modernisation programme is now underway: Brisbane, started September 1985,  
completed December 1987; Hobart, started March 1989, completes 1991; Perth,  
started March 1987, completed December 1989. Major equipment being  
upgraded: search radars, naval combat data system, gun systems, the Mk 13  
missile launcher. Missile modernisation includes decoy and improved ECM  
equipment; three dimensional radar SPS 52B upgraded to SPS 52C; CIWS Vulcan  
Phalanx will not now be fitted.  
STRUCTURE     : Generally similar to the US Charles F Adams class, but they  
differ by the addition of a broad deckhouse between the funnels enclosing  
the Ikara anti-submarine torpedo-carrying missile system.

COMPLEMENT    : 14 (3 officers)  
  
GUNS          : 4 - 12.7 mm MGs.  
COUNTERMEASURE: MCM system is containerised allowing for rapid  
replacement or removal. Four sub-systems are located in the container -  
sonar, tactical data, precision navigation and mine disposal weapon  
control. The latter operates a remote-controlled ECA 38 system using two  
PAP 104 vehicles.  
RADARS        : Navigation: Kelvin Hughes Type 1006; I band.  
SONARS        : Krupp Atlas or Thomson Sintra; hull-mounted; minehunting; high  
frequency.  
  
PROGRAMMES    : Tenders for two prototypes of this totally new concept of  
minehunters were sought in April 1981. Ordered January 1983. First launched  
3 May 1986; second 20 June 1987. If the prototypes are successful a further  
four may be ordered. A$1.5 million allocated in 1987 for long lead items  
for further ships of the class, one of which was laid down 22 September  
1987. Trials are expected to complete in 1992 after long delays caused by  
propulsion and sonar problems and the need to evaluate a Krupp Atlas  
replacement for the DSQS-11H alongside one from Thomson Sintra.  
STRUCTURE     : The catamaran hull form was chosen as it provides stability, a  


large deck area, greater manoeuvrability than a mono-hull and reduction in  
signatures by placing heavy machinery high in the ship. Each hull is 3 m  
beam with 3 m space between. Foam sandwich construction has been adopted as  
has a policy of repair by replacement.  
OPERATIONAL   : Victualling consists of pre-prepared foods.  
Sales: Interest has been shown by several Middle East and South-East Asian  
nations and for that reason trials problems have been particularly  
disappointing.

amphibians or side-carried pontoons for ship-to-shore movement. A special  
feature is the ship's heavy lift derrick system for handling heavy loads.  
The LSH is able to embark a squadron of Leopard tanks plus a number of  
wheeled vehicles and artillery in addition to its troop lift. Bow and stern  
ramps are fitted. Carries two 20 kt waterjet LCVPs at davits. Fitted for  
side-carrying two NLE pontoons. Two LCM 8 carried on deck. Helicopters can  
be operated from the well deck or the after platform.  
OPERATIONAL   : A comprehensive communication fit and minor hospital  
facilities are provided. Can operate all in-service helicopters. Based at  
Sydney.  
OPINION       : There is a need for a helicopter support ship with vertical lift 
to complement Tobruk; Jervis Bay started fitting out for the role in late

by Avibras FILA 20 mm A/A gun systems and Plessey Shield decoy system  
added. In July 1988 this programme was reported as `delayed by financial  
problems' and may have been cancelled.  
STRUCTURE     : F 40, 41, 44 and 45 are of the A/S configuration. F 42 and 43  
are General Purpose design. Materials, equipment and lead-yard services  
supplied by Vosper Thornycroft at Navyard, Rio de Janeiro. Fitted with  
retractable stabilisers. Seventh ship with differing armament was ordered  
from Navyard, Rio de Janeiro in June 1981 and is used as a training ship.  
OPERATIONAL   : Exceptionally economical in personnel, amounting to a 50 per  
cent reduction of manpower in relation to previous warships of this size  
and complexity. Endurance, 45 days' stores, 60 days' provisions. Oil fuel,  
530 tons.

second pair 9 January 1986. In mid-1986 the Government approved in  
principle construction of a total of 16 ships but this was not a commitment  
to finance them. First of class trials March 1989 but in-service date now  
planned for early 1991.  
STRUCTURE     : The plan was that later ships might carry Brazilian made  
Barracuda instead of Exocet, eight Avibras SSAI-N anti-submarine rocket  
launchers and an Avibras FILA 20 mm anti-air gun system in place of the  
Bofors 40 mm, but all of this has been cancelled. A single tube SAM is a  
possibility to replace the Phalanx which is not yet fitted.

PROGRAMMES    : In 1962 the Ministry of National Defence announced that Canada  
was to buy three Oberon class submarines in the UK. The first of these  
patrol submarines was obtained by the Canadian Government from the Royal  
Navy construction programme. She was laid down as Onyx but launched as  
Ojibwa. The other two were Canadian orders. There were some design changes  
to meet specific new needs including installation of RCN communications  
equipment and increase of air-conditioning capacity to meet the wide  
extremes of climate encountered in Canadian operating areas. All are due  
for disposal after 1996.  
MODERNISATION : All underwent SOUP (Submarine Operational Update Project)  
with more modern sonar and fire control equipment fitted. Ojibwa 1980-82,  
Onondaga 1982-84 and Okanagan 1984-86. In 1987 Singer Librascope was  
awarded a contract to upgrade weapon launching and fire control systems to  
take the US Mk 48 torpedo which has replaced the Mk 37 in the bow tubes.  
Plessey Triton sonar suite purchased in May 1989 for urgent retrofit in all  
three of the class.

PROGRAMMES    : Transferred 6 April 1982 (Prat), 22 June 1984 (Cochrane), 3  
October 1986 (Latorre) and 12 August 1987 (Blanco Encalada). Extensive  
refits carried out after transfer. Glamorgan renamed Latorre after the  
Swedish built cruiser which paid off in 1986. Although all are named after  
senior officers, the titles Almirante and Capitan are not used.  
MODERNISATION : Blanco Encalada converted at Talcahuano into helicopter  
carrier for two Super Pumas completed May 1988; Cochrane to follow with  
planned completion in early 1992. The remaining two will serve as  
Flagships. All of the class to get PDMS, probably the Israeli Barak I and  
new command, control and communications and ECM equipment. Latorre was  
transferred with 40 mm guns in lieu of Sea Cats (damaged in the Falklands  
War).  
STRUCTURE     : Blanco Encalada and in due course Cochrane are now markedly  
different in appearance from their two half-sisters with a greatly enlarged  
flight deck continued right aft to accommodate two large helicopters  
simultaneously, making her effectively flush-decked. The hangar has also  
been completely rebuilt and resembles that of the fleet oiler Montt (ex-RFA  


Tidepool).

PROGRAMMES    : Ordered in May 1955. Layout and general arrangements are  
conventional.  
MODERNISATION : Both modernised by Swan Hunter in co-operation with  
Plessey: Almirante Williams in 1971-74 and Almirante Riveros in 1973-75. In  
the late 1980s both were given a further extensive refit with the addition  
of modern electronic equipment. Israeli Barak I may replace Sea Cat but  
these ships have a lower priority than the County and Leander classes.  
OPERATIONAL   : 4 in guns were removed one at a time for refurbishment in  
1986-88 and ships operated minus one or two turrets each while the work was  
done. In Almirante Williams the Y turret position is used as a helicopter  
platform.

HELICOPTERS   : 2 Harbin Z-9A (Dauphin) {r10} (in Jinan).  
  
PROGRAMMES    : The first Chinese-designed destroyers of such a capability to  
be built. First of class completed in 1971. 105-110 built at Luda; 131-134  
at Shanghai and 161-165 at Guangzhou. Similar to Soviet Kotlin class. The  
programme was much retarded after 1971 when the death of Lin Biao was  
followed by drastic cuts in the defence budget. In early 1977 building of  
series two of this class was put in hand and includes those after 109, all  
but one of which commissioned in the 1980s with the latest 164 in April  
1987 and 165 in early 1990. The order of completion was 105, 160  
(scrapped), 106, 161, 107, 162, 131, 108, 132, 109, 163, 110, 133, 134, 164  
and 165. Building continues.  
MODERNISATION : First of class 105 completed a major refit in 1987 as a  
trials ship, with the after armament replaced by a twin helicopter hangar  
and deck. There are also said to be plans to replace the Fei Lung 2 SSM  
launchers by a quadruple trainable C801 launcher between the funnels, and  
the fwd 130 mm mounting by a twin 100 mm mounting (similar to those in the  
Jiangdong class).  
STRUCTURE     : Electronics vary in later ships. Some ships have 57 mm guns,  
others 37 mm. Jinan may have Alcatel `Safecopter' landing aid.  
OPERATIONAL   : Capable of foreign deployment, although command and control  
is limited. Underway refuelling is practised. Deployment; 105 series in  
North and East Sea Fleets; 131 series in East Sea Fleet; 161 series in  
South Sea Fleet. 160 was damaged by an explosion in 1978, and was scrapped.  
105 completed helicopter trials in December 1987 following modifications  
made by the China Design and Research Institute for shipborne operations.  
133, 134 and 164 all operated in the vicinity of the Spratley Islands in  
early 1989.

PROGRAMMES    : In September 1978 a decision was taken to proceed with the  
construction of a sixth SNLE to be of an intermediate type between her  
predecessors and the Triomphant class. The sixth hull was found to be  


necessary if three submarines are to be continuously available, with two on  
patrol. Service life to 2012.  
MODERNISATION : The M4 missile is to be replaced by the M45 as an  
intermediate system until the M5 is available in the late 1990s. The M45  
uses M4 first and second stage propulsion units but has new electronics and  
new warheads.  
STRUCTURE     : Diving depth, 300 m (984 ft). Similar propulsion plant to  
previous SNLE but with improved noise reduction.  
OPERATIONAL   : The M4 ballistic missile system will combine with improved  
inertial navigation systems, sonar, diving depth, reactor and armament to  
provide a submarine `qui utilisera les techniques des annees 80' as M.  
Bourges (late Minister of Defence) described it.

20 km (10.8 nm) at 40 kts; warhead 250 kg; depth 600 m (1970 ft). Total of  
18 torpedoes and missiles carried in a mixed load.  
MINES         : Up to 32 FG 29 in lieu of torpedoes.  
COUNTERMEASURE: ESM: ARUR, ARUD; intercept and warning.  
Fire control: SADE tactical data handling. DLT D3 torpedo control.  
RADARS        : Search: Thomson-CSF DRUA 33; I band.  
SONARS        : Thomson Sintra DSUV 22 or DMUX 20 multi-function (S605 onwards); 
passive search; low frequency.  
 DUUA 2B; active; medium frequency; 8 kHz.  
 DUUX 2 or DUUX 5; passive ranging and intercept.  
 DSUV 62; towed passive array; very low frequency (to be fitted in all by  
1991).  
  
PROGRAMMES    : Rubis refitted 1986-88; Saphir started refit September 1989,  
to complete June 1991.  
 Nos 605-608 are being built to a modified design. This includes a new bow  
form, Syracuse 2 Satcom System, a new design sonar DMUX 20 in place of DSUV  
22, a new DSUV 62 towed array sonar, a major silencing programme, a  
streamlining of the superstructure as well as new tactical and attack  
systems and improved electronics. Amethyste started trials 4 October 1989  
and will commission in 1991. The programme has been slowed down by defence  
economies imposed in 1989. SNA No 9 (displacement: 4000 tons) will be of a  
new and improved class with VLS SSM and should enter service in the next  


century.  
MODERNISATION : Between 1989 and 1995 the first four boats of this class  
are being converted under operation Amethyste (AMelioration Tactique  
HYdrodynamique Silence Transmission Ecoute) to bring them to the same  
standard of ASW efficiency as the later boats rather than that required for  
the original anti-surface ship role.  
STRUCTURE     : Diving depth, 300 m (984 ft). As this is the smallest class of  
SSNs ever designed except for the 400 ton NR-1 of the US Navy there has  
clearly been a marked reduction in the size of the reactor compared with  
the Le Redoutable class. S 605 and onwards have had their length increased  
to 241.5 ft (73.6 m)  
OPERATIONAL   : Two squadrons of these submarines are forecast to be based at  
Toulon and probably Lorient. The first five will all be based at Toulon.  
Endurance up to 60 days.

allotted in 1978 estimates, for the second in 1979 estimates (ordered 27  
September 1979), and for the third and fourth in 1983 estimates. Third and  
fourth ships orered 27 February 1984, but indefinitely postponed. The  
building programme has been considerably slowed down by finance problems  
and doubts about the increasingly obsolescent Standard SM 1 missile system,  
and the SM 2 is reported as being too expensive. Service lives: First,

specifically for service on overseas stations. First three ordered 25 July  
1988; being built at Lorient Dockyard. First to commission in late 1994;  
three more should be ordered in 1992. The programme has been delayed by up  
to one year by the 1989 defence budget and the fourth of class is unlikely  
to commission before 1998.  
STRUCTURE     : Space left for a SAAM launcher forward of the bridge and this  
could replace Crotale. This might mean putting the Arabel fire control  
radar on top of a more solid looking foremast once Crotale is removed.  
Superstructure inclines at 10~ to the vertical to reduce radar echoing  
area. SLAT anti-torpedo system may be fitted when available. Magazine for  
AM 39 Exocet for the NFH-90 helicopter.

2 August 1980. D 217 and ex-USS Dyess DD 880 transferred 27 February 1981  
by sale. (Myles C Fox and Dyess transferred for spares.) D 210 was a FRAM  
II Radar Picket conversion, remainder are FRAM I DD conversions.  
MODERNISATION : Major modernisation programme in 1987-88 for all except D  


210. Included Harpoon, OTO Melara 76 mm/62 gun placed aft and a new FCS  
(NA-30 or NA-21). D 216 and D 217 completed in 1987 without Harpoon but  
with a forward Bofors 40 mm/70 mounted between the torpedo tubes. D 210,  
refitted in the Eleusis Shipyard, received a telescopic hangar for a larger  
helicopter (AB 212). Harpoon is not always carried and there is a  
possibility that one more of the class may be given a telescopic hangar.

COMMENT       : Enquiries in hand with several firms for a class of frigates  
broadly in line with the details listed above. It is reported that German  
and Dutch designs are short-listed but that lack of funds has delayed the  
placing of contracts until mid-1990 at the earliest. The plan is to build  
all but the first of class at PT Pal Surabaya Shipyard with the first in  
service by the late 1990s.

PROGRAMMES    : First laid down early 1983 by Korea SEC. The pennant  
number/name attribution shown above is uncertain after Chon An (772) but  
names and shipbuilders are correct. Four more of the class are scheduled  
for completion in 1991-92.  
STRUCTURE     : It is probable that there are three groups specialising in  
surface-to-surface warfare, anti-submarine and, possibly to come, air  
defence. The first group therefore have no ASW equipment and starting with  
An Dong (766) the second group have no SSM. The second group also have an  
improved combat data system.

PROGRAMMES    : Ordered on 29 June 1977. Associated US firms were Gibbs and  
Cox, Dixencast, Bath Iron Works and Sperry SM. Commissioning delays caused  
by changes to command and control systems and the addition of a Flag  
Bridge.

Two flight deck lifts, one right aft. Two LCVPs carried. Two pairs of fin  
stabilisers. The hangar is 24748 sq ft (2300 m). The Battle Group  
Commander occupies the lower bridge. Two saluting guns have been mounted on  
the port quarter.  
OPERATIONAL   : Three Sea Kings have Searchwater AEW radar. Aircraft  
complement could be increased to 37 (parking on deck) in an emergency but  
maximum operational number is 24. A typical air wing will include eight  
Matador IIs and nine Sea Kings (including two AEW). Ship is based at Rota.  
OPINION       : In a major exercise in 1989 the air wing comprised 10 fixed wing 
aircraft and 10 helicopters and flying operations were reported as being  
sustained for up to 18 hours a day. For full 24 hour a day aircraft  
availability, more aircrew accommodation is needed.

PROGRAMMES    : This class resulted from a very close co-operation between  
Spain and the USA. Programme approved 17 November 1964, technical support  
agreement with USA being signed 31 March 1966. US Navy supplied weapons and  
sensors. Major hull sections, turbines and gearboxes made at El Ferrol,  
superstructures at Alicante, boilers, distilling plants and propellers at  
Cadiz.  
MODERNISATION : The mid-life update programme is being done in two stages;  
all had completed the first stage by the end of 1987 and Asturias was the  
first to be fully modernised in 1988; Extremadura completed in May 1989 and  
Cataluna in early 1990. Baleares completes in July 1990 and Andalucia in  
February 1991. Changes include the fitting of two Meroka 20 mm CIWS, Link  
11, Tritan data control, Deneb passive EW systems, four Mk 36 SRBOC Chaff  
launchers and replacing SQS 23 with DE 1160 sonar. The programme is on  
schedule except for the sonars.  
STRUCTURE     : Generally similar to US Navy's Knox class although they differ  
in the missile system, hull sonar, Mk 25 torpedo tubes and lack of  
helicopter facilities.

PROGRAMMES    : On 15 July 1980 the Government announced its intention to  
procure from the United States the Trident I weapon system, comprising the  
C4 ballistic missile and supporting systems for a force of new British  


missile launching submarines to replace the present Polaris-equipped force  
in the 1990s. On 11 March 1982 it was announced that the Government had  
opted to procure the improved Trident II weapon system, with the D5  
missile, to be deployed in a force of four submarines, in the mid-1990s. A  
16000 ton capacity ship-lift is used to launch the completed hulls,  
each requiring 12500 tons of steel. Vanguard ordered 30 April 1986;  
Victorious 6 October 1987. The original programme anticipated ordering one  
per year for the first three years so there has been a delay of over a year  
on the third which is now due to be ordered in April 1990.  
STRUCTURE     : Refit and recore interval is anticipated at 8-9 years. The  
outer surface of the submarine will be covered with conformal anechoic  
noise reduction coatings. An optronic mast will be a new feature.  
OPERATIONAL   : After some early problems there were three successful  
submerged launched firings of the D5 missile from USS Tennessee in December  
1989.  
OPINION       : Because the funding for Trident has come mainly from the naval  
share of the defence budget, it is having a detrimental effect on the  
equipment programmes for the rest of the Fleet. Annual expenditure peaked  
in 1989/90 and remains at a high level for the next five years, although  
over the last four years there has been a reduction in the estimated cost  
of the programme by some 25 per cent.

PROGRAMMES    : In February 1963 it was stated that it was intended to order  
four or five 7000 ton nuclear powered submarines, each to carry 16 Polaris  
missiles, and it was planned that the first would be on patrol in 1968.  
Their hulls and machinery would be of British design. As well as building  
two submarines Vickers (Shipbuilding) would give lead yard service to the  
builder of the other two. Four Polaris submarines were in fact ordered in  
May 1963. The plan to build a fifth Polaris submarine was cancelled on 15  
February 1965. Britain's first SSBN, Resolution, put to sea on 22 June  
1967.  
OPERATIONAL   : Since early 1969 there has been at least one of these  
submarines on patrol and at immediate readiness to fire its  
inter-continental ballistic missiles. Each submarine, which has  
accommodation for 19 officers and 135 ratings, is manned on a two-crew  
basis, in order to get maximum operational time at sea. It has been  
reported that the Polaris stockpile is some 70 missiles with 45-50  
warheads.

PROGRAMMES    : It was announced on 31 August 1960 that the contract for a  
second nuclear powered submarine (Valiant) to follow Dreadnought had been  
awarded to Vickers Ltd, the principal sub-contractors being  
Vickers-Armstrong (Engineers) Ltd, for the machinery and its installation,  
and Rolls-Royce and Associates for the nuclear steam raising plant. She was  
originally scheduled to be completed in September 1965, but work was held  
up by the Polaris programme. Valiant ordered 31 August 1960; Warspite, 12  
December 1962; Churchill, 21 October 1965; Conqueror, 9 August 1966;  
Courageous, 1 March 1967. All were to stay in commission until the W class  
replaced them, but the postponement of the W class programme means that  
some will pay off without replacement in the late 1990s.  
STRUCTURE     : Control gear by MacTaggart, Scott & Co Ltd for: attack and  
search periscopes, radar, ESM and communication masts, snort induction and  
exhaust masts and ALK buoy. Valiant`s reactor core was made in the UK, with  
machinery of British design and manufacture similar to the shore prototype  
installed in the Admiralty Reactor Test Establishment at Dounreay. The main  
steam turbines and condensers were designed and manufactured by the English  
Electric Company, Rugby, and the electrical propulsion machinery and  
control gear by Laurence, Scott & Electromotors Ltd. W H Allen  
turbo-generator sets. Diving depth, 230 m (750 ft).  
OPERATIONAL   : On 25 April 1967 Valiant completed the 12000 mile  
homeward voyage from Singapore, the record submerged passage by a British  
submarine, after 28 days non-stop. Conqueror was the first nuclear  
submarine of any nation to fire a shot in anger when she sank the Argentine  
cruiser Belgrano in May 1982. All belong to the Third Submarine Squadron.

submarines was acknowledged in the late 1970s and in 1979 the Type 2400  
design was first revealed. This was larger than first requested. First boat  
ordered from Vickers SEL, 2 November 1983. Further three ordered on 2  
January 1986. Cost is pds620 million (1987) for first four plus long lead  
items. Refit interval is anticipated at seven and a half years.  
STRUCTURE     : Single skinned NQ1 high tensile steel hull, tear dropped shape  
9:1 ratio, five man lock-out chamber in fin. This is the first time that  
the Valenta diesel has been provided in submarines. Fitted with elastomeric  
acoustic tiles. Diving depth, greater than 200 m (650 ft). Fifth of class  
will have a new sonar suite with Ferranti Type 2075 (integrated hull, towed

in 1987.  
MODERNISATION : The Triton sonar modernisation programme is updating all  
except Otus. By the beginning of 1990 all except Odin, Onslaught and Otus  
had been completed. Modernised submarines also have ESM outfit UAL and the  
capability to guide two torpedoes simultaneously. Otus did trials to  
establish the feasibility of fitting Sub Harpoon but there are no plans to  
retrofit the class.  
STRUCTURE     : For the first time in British submarines plastic was used in  
the superstructure construction of the Oberon class. Before and abaft the  
bridge the superstructure is mainly of glass fibre laminate. Control gear  
by MacTaggart, Scott and Co Ltd for: search and attack periscopes, radar,  
communications and EW masts, snort induction and exhaust masts. Diving  
depth, 200 m (650 ft).  
Sales: A total of 14 of this class were sold abroad, six to Australia,  
three to Canada, three to Brazil and two to Chile. Two more, Oberon and  
Walrus, are being refurbished for sale to Egypt and Olympus sailed to  
Canada in 1989 to become an alongside training boat. Otus is for sale in  
November 1990.

(see Shipborne Aircraft section) {r10}.  
HELICOPTERS   : Up to 9 Westland Sea King HAS 5 {r11}; 3 Westland Sea King  
AEW 2.  
  
PROGRAMMES    : The first of class, the result of many compromises, was  
ordered from Vickers on 17 April 1973. The order for the second ship was  
placed on 14 May 1976, the third, R 07 in December 1978.  
MODERNISATION : In January 1989 R 05 completed a 27 month modernisation  
which included a 12~ Ski ramp, space and support facilities for at least 21  
aircraft (Sea Harriers, Sea King AEW and ASW helicopters), three Goalkeeper  


systems, Sonar 2016, Seagnat decoys, 996 radar, Flag and Command facilities  
to R 07 standards and accommodation for an extra 120 enlarged aircrew and  
Flag Staff. R 06 will start a similar modernisation in 1991, including  
Seawolf with four lightweight launchers and two Type 911(3) radars. The  
long term plan is to retrofit Seawolf GWS 26 Mod 2A (lightweight) in all  
three of the class.  
STRUCTURE     : The design allows for an open fo'c'sle head and a slightly  
angled deck which allows the Sea Dart launcher to be set almost amidships.  
In 1976-77 an amendment was incorporated to allow for the transport and  
landing of an RM Commando. The forward end of the flight deck (ski-ramp)  
allows STOVL aircraft of greater all-up weight to operate more efficiently.  
R 05 and R 07 have a 12~ ski-ramp which is to be retrofitted in R 06 which  
currently has a 7~ ramp.  
OPERATIONAL   : The role of this class, apart from its primary task of  
providing a command, control and communications facility, is the operation  
of both helicopters and STOVL aircraft. Provision has been made for  
sufficiently large lifts and hangars to accommodate the next generation of  
both these aircraft. Only two of the class are in commission at any one  
time, the third either being in refit or stand-by. In 1990 R 06 is in a  
state of `preservation by operation' and is used by training establishments  
in the Portsmouth area.

PROGRAMMES    : Designed to provide area air defence for a task force. In  
order to provide space for improved weapon systems and to improve speed and  
seakeeping a radical change was made to this class. The completion of later  
ships was delayed to allow for some modifications resulting from experience  
in the Falklands' campaign (1982).  
MODERNISATION : Vulcan Phalanx replaced BMARC 30 mm guns 1987-89. All to  
receive Plessey Type 996 radar in place of Type 992 and Type 9091 fire  
control radars with improved Tx/Rx circuits. STWS Mk 3 is replacing Mk 2 in  
1990-91 in Batch 3 and will then be retrofitted to Batches 1 and 2. Long  
term plan is to retrofit lightweight Seawolf GWS 26 Mod 2 (two launchers  
and two Type 911(3) radars) but possibly only to Batch 3 starting in 1991.  
STRUCTURE     : All have two pairs of stabilisers and twin rudders. Advantages  
of gas turbine propulsion include ability to reach maximum speed with great  
rapidity, reduction in space and weight and 25 per cent reduction in  
technical manpower. The stretched Batch 3 are being fitted with a  
strengthening beam on each side which increases displacement by 150 tons  
and width by 2 feet.  
OPERATIONAL   : The helicopter carries the Sea Skua (CK 834) air-to-surface  
weapon for use against lightly defended surface ship targets. Southampton  
badly damaged underwater in collision with a tanker in the Gulf and had to  
be transported home arriving December 1988. Will be out of action until  


1992 and will receive Illustrious' Sea Dart. Ships may be fitted with DEC  
laser dazzle sight on operational deployments.

HELICOPTERS   : 1 Westland Lynx HAS 3 (1 EH 101 Merlin, later) {r10}.  
  
PROGRAMMES    : The first of this class was ordered from Yarrows on 29 October  
1984. Next three ordered September 1986, with four more out to tender in  
October 1987 but only three ordered in July 1988. Again four out to tender  
in late 1988 and only three ordered 19 December 1989. Norfolk completed sea  
trials in July 1989.  
STRUCTURE     : Incorporates stealth technology to minimise acoustic, magnetic,  
radar and IR signatures. The design includes a 7~ slope to all vertical  
surfaces, rounded edges, reduction of IR emissions and a hull bubble system  
to reduce radiated noise. The combined diesel electric and GT propulsion  
system provides quiet motive power during towed sonar operations. A CIWS  
gun is not fitted but a possible extension by 7 m at some stage in the  
building programme would allow one or two Goalkeeper to be carried and  
increase Seawolf magazine capacity. The early Type 23s will lack fully  
automated co-ordination of all weapons and sensors until about 1993-94 when  
the SSCS system is installed.  
OPERATIONAL   : The ship is capable of carrying out all weapon systems  
functions without the SSCS Combat Data System. The problem is that in  
multi-threat situations command speed of response will in theory be much  
slower.

HELICOPTERS   : 1 Westland Lynx HAS 3 {r10}.  
  
PROGRAMMES    : A contract was awarded to Vosper Thornycroft on 27 February  
1968 for the design of a patrol frigate to be prepared in full  
collaboration with Yarrow Ltd. This is the first custom built gas turbine  
frigate (designed and constructed as such from the keel up, as opposed to  
conversion) and the first RN warship designed by commercial firms for many  
years.  
MODERNISATION : During service life, GWS 50 Exocet, SCOT, STWS Mk 1 and  
Lynx helicopter facilities added.  
STRUCTURE     : Due to severe cracking in the upper deck structure large  
strengthening pieces have been fixed to the ships' side at the top of the  
steel hull as shown in the illustration. The addition of permanent ballast  
to improve stability has increased displacement by about 350 tons. Further  
hull modifications to reduce noise and vibration started in 1988 to  
complete in all of the class by 1992.  
OPERATIONAL   : Form 4th Frigate Squadron (leader, Active).

PROGRAMMES    : This class whose construction extended over 10 years was an  
improvement on the Type 12. As originally designed there were several  
significant improvements - a helicopter, VDS and long-range air warning  
radar being the most important. Since 1974 a number of conversions have  
been put in hand. Batch 1 ships disposal list April 1989; Batch 3B also  
being sold off although Ariadne may survive until 1991 as part of the  
Dartmouth Training Squadron with Minerva.  
MODERNISATION : Batch 3 conversion includes the provision of four Exocet  
launchers, the Seawolf SAM system, improved sonar, Lynx helicopter, modern  
EW equipment and STWS torpedo tubes. At the same time the 114 mm turret,  
Seacat and Limbo are removed. A further conversion of four of Batch 2  
(listed above as Batch 2 TA) and Arethusa has included the installation of  
a towed array on the quarter-deck. As a result of this extra 70 tons of  
top-weight the forward Seacat has been removed, the bridge 40 mm guns  
replaced by 20 mm, the Exocet mountings have been lowered, boats have been  
replaced by a Pacific 22 craft and small crane, the Type 965 radar aerial  
removed and the STWS torpedo tubes first moved down a deck and now being  
progressively removed. Marconi SCOT Satcom fitted to some. Close range gun

PROGRAMMES    : This class whose construction extended over 10 years was an  
improvement on the Type 12. As originally designed there were several  
significant improvements - a helicopter, VDS and long-range air warning  
radar being the most important. Since 1974 a number of conversions have  
been put in hand. Batch 1 ships disposal list April 1989; Batch 3B also  
being sold off although Ariadne may survive until 1991 as part of the  
Dartmouth Training Squadron with Minerva.  
MODERNISATION : Batch 3 conversion includes the provision of four Exocet  
launchers, the Seawolf SAM system, improved sonar, Lynx helicopter, modern  
EW equipment and STWS torpedo tubes. At the same time the 114 mm turret,  
Seacat and Limbo are removed. A further conversion of four of Batch 2  
(listed above as Batch 2 TA) and Arethusa has included the installation of  
a towed array on the quarter-deck. As a result of this extra 70 tons of  
top-weight the forward Seacat has been removed, the bridge 40 mm guns  
replaced by 20 mm, the Exocet mountings have been lowered, boats have been  
replaced by a Pacific 22 craft and small crane, the Type 965 radar aerial  
removed and the STWS torpedo tubes first moved down a deck and now being  
progressively removed. Marconi SCOT Satcom fitted to some. Close range gun  
armament refits vary between ships in same Batch. Juno`s Batch 2 conversion  


was halted. Converted in Rosyth as a training ship and now stripped of  
missiles and most sensors.  
STRUCTURE     : Batch 1: Y-100 machinery. Batch 2/2A: Y-136. Batch 3: Y-160.  
Sales: Bacchante and Dido to New Zealand, the former on 1 October 1982  
and Dido on 18 July 1983. Apollo and Diomede to Pakistan in 1988. Euryalus  
and Arethusa put on the disposal list in April 1989 and may go to  
Indonesia; Achilles in March 1990.

PROGRAMMES    : In 1981 their impending deletion was announced - Intrepid in  
1982 and Fearless in 1984. In February 1982 it was reported that they were  
to be reprieved, a fortunate decision in view of the vital part played by  
both in the 1982 Falklands' campaign. A replacement for one of the class  
should be ordered in 1990-91 and the second in the mid-1990s.  
MODERNISATION : Intrepid refitted 1984-85. Fearless completes refit in  
April 1990 and is being fitted with two Vulcan Phalanx 20 mm gun  
mountings.  
STRUCTURE     : The two funnels are staggered across the beam of the ship.  
Landing craft are floated through the open stern by flooding compartments  
of the ship and lowering her in the water. They are able to deploy tanks,  
vehicles and men and have seakeeping qualities much superior to those of  
tank landing ships as well as greater speed and range. The helicopter  
platform is also the deckhead of the dock.  
OPERATIONAL   : Each ship is fitted out as a Naval Assault Group/Brigade  
Headquarters with an Assault Operations Room from which naval and military  
personnel can mount and control the progress of an assault operation.  
OPINION       : These ships are not in good enough condition to extend their  
lives and a decision has been taken to replace them. The design will be  
based on work already done by the consortia, which completed the survey in  
1989.

COMMENT       : Designed for use by Her Majesty The Queen in peacetime as the  
Royal Yacht but can be converted as a medium sized naval hospital ship.  
Construction conformed to mercantile practice. Fitted with Denny-Brown  
single fin stabilisers to reduce roll in bad weather from 20 to 6 degrees.  
To pass under the bridges of the St. Lawrence Seaway when she visited  


Canada, the top 20 ft of her mainmast and the radio aerial on her foremast  
were hinged in November 1958 so that they could be lowered as required.  
1984 refit included conversion to diesel fuel. Satnav fitted. Further refit  
carried out at Devonport 1986-87 which will extend her life by 10-15 years.  
Oil fuel, 330 tons (510 with auxiliary fuel tanks).

COMMENT       : Ordered 28 September 1979 after design contract of June 1977.  
Launched 19 May 1981. Carries an LR 5 submersible for stern-launching plus  
a diving bell or submerged recompression chamber lowered from well  
amidships (moonpool) with a crane for recovering submerged objects. Dynamic  
positioning system. During 1986-87 major work was undertaken by Thorn EMI  
to replace and update the Saturation Diving System. This provides  
accommodation for 12 divers in two pressurised chambers on board. Three men  
at a time are then transferred under pressure to the diving chamber and  
lowered to the target area. Further trials conducted 1988-89 to evaluate  
the submersible and diving systems. This ship has so far proved to be poor  
value for the money spent on her but there are now signs of a better  
performance.

HELICOPTERS   : Hangar space for 3 Westland Sea King/EH 101 helicopters.  
  
PROGRAMMES    : The requirement for these ships is to provide fuel and stores  
support to the Fleet at sea. Fort Victoria ordered 23 April 1986 and  
Fort George on 18 December 1987. The original plan was for six of this  
class. In view of the cost this now seems unlikely and unarmed variants may  
be built instead.  
STRUCTURE     : Four dual purpose abeam replenishment rigs for simultaneous  
transfer of liquids and solids. Stern refuelling. Repair facilities for EH  
101 helicopters.  
OPERATIONAL   : Two helicopter spots. There is a requirement to provide an  
emergency landing facility for Sea Harriers.  
OPINION       : Combined civilian and naval manning on this scale is  
cost-effective in accountancy terms. Its operational efficiency has not yet  
been judged.

PROGRAMMES    : Ro-ro container ship whose conversion for her new task was  
begun by Harland and Wolff in March 1984 and completed on 3 March 1988.  
Purchase price approx pds18 million; conversion approx pds45 million which  
included full contractor responsibility for equipment, trials and setting  
to work. Dedication ceremony 1 June 1988. Relieved Engadine in early 1989.  
STRUCTURE     : Uses former ro-ro deck as hangar with four sliding WT doors  
able to operate at a speed of 10 m per minute. Can replenish other ships  
underway. One lift port midships, one abaft funnel. Domestic facilities are  
very limited if she is to be used in the Command support role. Flight deck  
is 372.4 ft (113.5 m) long and has a 5 ft thick concrete layer on its lower  
side. First RFA to be fitted with a command system.  
OPERATIONAL   : Not as heavily armed as Fort Victoria will be but similar  
advantage is being taken of the cost effectiveness of mixed civilian and  
naval manning.

Islands. Tyne Shiprepairers were given a contract to repair and modify her.  
This included lengthening by 29 ft, an enlarged flight deck capable of  
taking Chinooks and a new bridge. The aluminium superstructure was replaced  
by steel and the provision of new communications, an EMR, Satcom, new  
navigation systems and helicopter control radar greatly increase her  
effectiveness. Completed 9 October 1985. The first three are to be  
modernised to the same standard as Sir Tristram with SLEPs in the 1990s.

PROGRAMMES    : The first four (SSBN 616, 617, 619, 620) were authorised in  
the FY 1961 shipbuilding programme with five additional submarines (SSBN  
622-626) in a supplemental. SSBN 627-636 (ten) in the FY 1962, SSBN 640-645  
(six) in the FY 1963, and SSBN 654-659 (six) in the FY 1964. In early 1986,  
on commissioning of Alaska SSBN 732, Sam Rayburn had her missile tubes  
plugged in order to keep within limits of the SALT agreement and has  
converted to a `moored nuclear reactor training submarine'. Later in the  
year Nathan Hale and Nathan Greene were decommissioned. Andrew Jackson and  


John Adams paid off in 1989 and James Monroe and Henry Clay are to follow  
in 1990. Henry Clay may follow Sam Rayburn as a second moored training  
ship.  
MODERNISATION : The first eight submarines of this class were fitted with  
the Polaris A-2 missile (1500 nm range) and the next 23 with the Polaris  
A-3 missile (2500 nm range). All were then fitted with Poseidon between  
1970 and 1977. Between 24 September 1978 and 10 December 1982 twelve were  
converted to launch Trident I missiles. The conversion included minor  
modifications to the launcher and to the ballasting of the submarine to  
accommodate the greater weight of the Trident missile as well as extensive  
modifications to the installed fire control, instrumentation and missile  
checkout subsystems to support the increased sophistication of the longer  
range missile. Francis Scott Key served as a sea-going test bed for the  
testing phase. She completed her trials role and returned to her deterrent  
mission on 20 October 1979 as the first SSBN to deploy with the Trident I  
missile.  
STRUCTURE     : Benjamin Franklin and subsequent submarines of this class have  
been fitted with quieter machinery and are considered as a separate class.  
All SSBNs have diesel-electric stand-by machinery, snorts, and `outboard'  
auxiliary propeller for emergency use. The nuclear cores inserted during  
the late 1960s and early 1970s provide energy for approximately 400000  
miles. Diving depth is approx 300 m (984 ft).  
OPERATIONAL   : Three Mk 2 Mod 4 Ship's Inertial Navigation System (SINS) are  
fitted. Navigation data produced by SINS can be provided to each missile's  
guidance package until the instant the missile is fired. All fitted with  
navigational satellite receivers. Most of the class have two alternating  
crews designated `Blue' and `Gold'. Each crew does a 70 day patrol and  
partially assists during the intermediate 30 day refit alongside a tender.  
A 22-23 month refit is required every six years. Trident fitted SSBNs of  
this class are based at King's Bay, Georgia.

STRUCTURE     : These submarines are slightly larger than the Permit class and  
can be identified by their taller sail structure and the lower position of  
their diving planes on the sail (to improve control at periscope depth).  
Sail height is 20 ft 6 in above deck. Sail-mounted diving planes rotate to  
vertical for breaking through ice when surfacing in arctic regions. SSN  
678-684, 686 and 687 are 10 feet longer than remainder of class to  
accommodate BQQ 5 sonar and electronic gear. Under FY 1982 programme  
Cavalla was converted at Pearl Harbor in August-December 1982 to have a  
secondary amphibious assault role by carrying a Swimmer Delivery Vehicle  
(SDV). Archerfish, Silversides, Tunny and L Mendel Rivers are similarly  
equipped. William H Bates, Hawkbill, Pintado, Richard B Russell and others  
have been modified to carry and support the Navy's Deep Submergence Rescue  
Vehicles (DSRV). See section on Deep Submergence Vehicles for additional  
DSRV details. Silversides and Richard B Russell carry Bustle prototype  
communications buoy in container abaft the sail. Diving depth is 400 m  
(1320 feet). Acoustic tiles are fitted.  
OPERATIONAL   : Operational life is expected to be 30 years.

COMPLEMENT    : 127 (13 officers)  
  
MISSILES      : SSM: 4 McDonnell Douglas Harpoon can be embarked.  
TORPEDOES     : 4 - 21 in (533 mm) Mk 63 tubes midships, angled at 10 degrees  
from centreline. Gould Mk 48; wire-guided (option); active/passive homing  
to 50 km (27 nm)/38 km (21 nm) at 40/55 kts; warhead 267 kg; depth to 900 m  
(2950 ft).  
COUNTERMEASURE: Decoys: Emerson Electric Mk 2; torpedo decoy.  
ESM: WLR-1; radar intercept.  
Fire control: Mk 117 torpedo fire control system replacing Mk 113.  
RADARS        : Surface search/navigation/fire control: BPS 11/15; I/J band.  
SONARS        : Raytheon BQQ 3; passive/active search and attack; low frequency. 
Being replaced by BQQ 5 during refits.  
 Raytheon BQS 14; active mine and ice close-range detection; high frequency.  
 BQR 15; towed array; passive search; very low frequency.  
  
PROGRAMMES    : The lead ship of the class, Thresher (SSN 593), was authorised  
in the FY 1957 new construction programme. Thresher was lost off the coast  
of New England on 10 April 1963 while on post-overhaul trials.  
STRUCTURE     : These submarines have a modified `tear-drop' hull design. Their  
bows are devoted to sonar and their four torpedo tubes are amidships,  
angled out, two to port and two to starboard. Flasher, Gato and Greenling  
were modified during construction, fitted with SUBSAFE features (which were  
incorporated in the remainder of the class), heavier machinery, and larger  
sail structures. Jack was fitted with two propellers on one shaft (actually  
a single shaft within a sleeve-like shaft) and a contra-rotating turbine  
without a reduction gear. Both innovations were designed to reduce  
operating noises. This arrangement provided a 10 per cent increase in power  
efficiency, but no increase in speed. The arrangement was not a success and  
was removed. Diving depth probably reduced due to age.  
OPERATIONAL   : Planned decommissioning schedule was held up because of  
delays in the Improved Los Angeles class programme but Pollack paid off in  
January 1989, Plunger and Dace in late 1989/early 1990 and Barb is the next  
to go in August 1990. Six more are to be decommissioned in FY 1991.

HELICOPTERS   : 6 SH-3G/H/SH 60F Sea King.  
  
PROGRAMMES    : The lead ship for this class and the world's second  
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was ordered 9 years after the first such  
ship, Enterprise (CVN 65). Nimitz was authorised in FY 1967, Dwight D  
Eisenhower in FY 1970, Carl Vinson in FY 1974, Theodore Roosevelt in FY  
1980 and Abraham Lincoln and George Washington in FY 1983. The builders are  
the only US shipyard now capable of constructing large, nuclear-propelled  
surface warships.  
 In the FY 1988 budget the Navy sought $1.441 billion for long-lead  
items for two additional Nimitz class carriers. The principal rationale for  
the request was that advancing the dates for construction of these two new  
carriers would save almost $2 billion by ensuring a level work load at  
Newport News Shipbuilding, rather than causing the work force to be reduced  
as construction of Abraham Lincoln and George Washington neared completion.  


Subsequently, Congress took the unexpected action of including $6.325  
billion in the FY 1988 budget for their construction, even though actual  
outlays would not reach their highest levels until 1994-96. Construction  
contracts were awarded in June 1988.  
STRUCTURE     : Damage control measures include sides with system of full and  
empty compartments (full compartments can contain aviation fuel),  
approximately 2.5 in Kevlar plating over certain areas of side shell, box  
protection over magazine and machinery spaces. Aviation facilities include  
four lifts, two at the forward end of the flight deck, one to starboard  
abaft the island and one to port at the stern. There are four steam  
catapults (C13-1) and four (or three) Mk 7 Mod 3 arrester wires. Launch  
rate is one every 20 seconds. The hangar can hold less than half the full  
aircraft complement, deckhead is 25.6 ft. Aviation fuel, 9000 tons.  
Tactical Flag Command Centre for Flagship role.  
OPERATIONAL   : Multi-mission role of `attack/ASW'. From CVN 70 onwards ships  
have an A/S control centre and A/S facilities; CVN 68 and 69 will be back  
fitted.  
 Endurance of 16 days for aviation fuel (steady flying). 13 years'  
theoretical life for nuclear reactors (CVN 68-70); 15 years' (CVN 71-73);  
800000 to 1 million miles between refuelling.

HELICOPTERS   : 6 SH-3G/H/SH 60F Sea King.  
  
PROGRAMMES    : Authorised in FY 1958 and launched only 31 months after her  
keel was laid down. Underwent a refit/overhaul at Puget Sound Naval SY,  
Bremerton, Washington from January 1979 to March 1982 and is to receive  
`complex overhaul' from 1993-96, the CVN's equivalent of SLEP. $1.4  
billion provided in FY 1990 budget for a 42 month overhaul including  
refuelling.  
MODERNISATION : Enterprise was completed without any armament in an effort  
to hold down construction costs. Space for Terrier missile system was  
provided. Mk 25 Sea Sparrow BPDMS subsequently was installed in later 1967  
and this has been replaced by first two and then three Mk 29 and  
supplemented with three 20 mm Mk 15 CIWS. A re-shaping of the island took  
place in her 1979-82 refit. This included the removal of the mast and dome  
(which carried obsolete ECM gear) which were replaced with a mast similar  
to that of the Nimitz class. The `billboards' of the SPS 32 and 33 radars  
were removed and replaced by the antennas of SPS 48C and 49 radars on the  
new mast.  
STRUCTURE     : Built to a modified Forrestal class design. Enterprise was the  
world's second nuclear-powered warship (the cruiser Long Beach was  
completed a few months earlier). The first of the eight reactors installed  
in Enterprise achieved initial criticality on 2 December 1960, shortly  
after the carrier was launched. After three years of operation during which  
she steamed more than 207000 miles, Enterprise was refuelled from  
November 1964 to July 1965. Her second set of cores provided about  
300000 miles steaming. The eight cores initially installed cost $64  
million; the second set cost about $20 million. Refuelled again in 1970  
the third set of cores lasted for eight years until replaced in 1979-82  
overhaul. There are two reactors for each of the ship's four shafts. The  
eight reactors feed 32 heat exchangers. Aviation facilities include four  
deck edge lifts, two forward and one each side abaft the island. There are  
four 295 ft C 13 Mod 1 catapults. Hangars cover 216000 sq ft with 25 ft  
deck head. Aviation fuel, 8500 tons.  
OPERATIONAL   : 12 days' aviation fuel for intensive flying.

PROGRAMMES    : Kitty Hawk was authorised in FY 1956, Constellation in FY  
1957, America in FY 1961, and John F Kennedy in FY 1963.  
MODERNISATION : Service Life Extension Programme (SLEP): Kitty Hawk is  
expected to complete her SLEP in February 1991, and Constellation to  
commence hers in July 1990 and to complete it in early 1993. Kennedy and  
America tentatively are to follow Constellation in that order; however,  
with extensive budget cuts looming, and no certainty as to the number of  
carriers to remain active, only time will tell whether these ships will be  
modernised as planned (see commentary on SLEP at head of Aircraft Carrier  
section). $643.3 million was included in the FY 1990  
shipbuilding/conversion budget for procurement of materials required for  
Constellation SLEP. Despite the uncertain future, $113.1 million is being  
sought in FY 1991 for materials to be utilised in Kennedy SLEP.  
STRUCTURE     : These ships were built to an improved Forrestal design and are  
easily recognised by their island structure being set farther aft than the  
superstructure in the four Forrestal class ships. They have two deck-edge  
lifts forward of the superstructure, a third lift aft of the structure, and  
the port-side lift on the after quarter. This arrangement considerably  
improves flight deck operations. Four C13 steam catapults (with one C13-1  
in America and Kennedy) and four arrester wires. John F Kennedy and America  
have stern anchors as well as bow anchors because of their planned bow  
sonar domes. All have a small radar mast abaft the island. They are painted  
black between flight deck and bridge to mask jet exhaust stains. Aviation  
fuel of 5882 tons are carried.

PROGRAMMES    : Forrestal was the world's first aircraft carrier built after  
the Second World War. The Forrestal design drew heavily from the aircraft  
carrier United States (CVA 58) which was cancelled immediately after being  
laid down in April 1949. Forrestal was authorised in FY 1952, Saratoga  
followed in FY 1953, Ranger in FY 1954 and Independence in FY 1955.  
MODERNISATION : Service Life Extension Programme (SLEP): The Navy's  
aircraft carrier Service Life Extension Programme (SLEP) began with three  
ships of the Forrestal class. Saratoga from October 1980 to February 1983,  
Forrestal January 1983 to 20 May 1985, and Independence April 1985 to May  
1988. Ranger, the fourth ship of the class, is scheduled to receive a  
complex overhaul starting in early 1993 and completing in mid-1995. If this  
schedule is followed, and if the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard (which  
completed the others) is to be closed, a site for the overhaul must be  
determined later.  
 The four after 5 in guns were removed from Forrestal late in 1967 and a  
single BPDMS launcher for Sea Sparrow missiles was installed forward on the  
starboard side. Two Mk 25 BPDMS launchers fitted in Independence in 1973  
with the subsequent removal of all 5 in guns, Saratoga in 1974, Forrestal  
in 1976. These have been replaced by three Mk 29 GMLS launchers during SLEP  
and they have also been fitted in Ranger.  
STRUCTURE     : The Forrestal class ships were the first aircraft carriers  
designed and built specifically to operate jet- propelled aircraft.  
Forrestal was redesigned early in construction to incorporate  
British-developed angled flight deck and steam catapults. These were the  
first US aircraft carriers built with an enclosed bow area to improve  
seaworthiness. Other features include armoured flight deck and advanced  
underwater protection and internal compartmentation to reduce effects of  
conventional and nuclear attack. Mast configurations differ. Funnel height  
of Forrestal and Independence increased by 10 ft in 1980. Aviation  
facilities include four 72 x 50 ft (21.9 x 15.2 m) lifts with capacity  
of 99000 lb (45 tons), four steam catapults (2 C7 and 2 C 11 in 59-60,  
4 C7 in 61 and 4 C 13 in 62) and four arrester wires. During SLEP the port  
forward elevator in Independence was moved to the port quarter. Aviation  
fuel, 5500 tons.  
OPERATIONAL   : One of the class, Independence, will replace Midway in 1991  
based in Japan. Another one may take on the training role from Lexington,  
in due course.

PROGRAMMES    : The original three carriers of this class were the largest US  
warships constructed during the Second World War. Midway has been  
homeported at Yokosuka, Japan, since October 1973; she is the only US  
aircraft carrier to be based overseas.  
MODERNISATION : Extensively modernised. The main conversion (1955-57) gave  
her angled flight deck, steam catapults, an enclosed bow, new electronics,  
and new lift arrangement with one lift forward and one aft of island on  
starboard side and third lift outboard on port side aft. Midway's last  
modernisation resulted in an increase in draught which meant that her  
elevators were frequently engulfed in spray. To increase her buoyancy $30  
million was spent on providing blisters on either side 600 x 10 ft. The  


result was an increase in buoyancy, a decrease in spray problems, a much  
snappier roll and an increase in problems of aircraft recovery in a quarter  
sea. Further corrective action would mean changing the shape of the  
blisters.  
STRUCTURE     : Built to the same design with an original standard displacement  
of 45000 tons, this class were the first US aircraft carriers with an  
armoured flight deck and the first US warships with a designed width too  
large to enable them to pass through the Panama Canal. Two C13 steam  
catapults. Three deck edge elevators. Three arrester wires.  
OPERATIONAL   : Sister ship Coral Sea decommissioned in April 1990 and it is  
anticipated that Midway may soon follow, having first been replaced in  
Japan by Independence in 1991.

PROGRAMMES    : Lexington was originally an Essex class carrier. She was  
extensively modernised in the 1950s. Reclassified as an ASW Support Carrier  
(CVS) in 1962, she became the Navy's training aircraft carrier, based in  
Pensacola, in December 1962. She was reclassified CVT in 1969 and AVT in  
1978, and will continue as the Navy's training carrier for the immediate  
future but will be relieved in the early 1990s. Her remaining sister ships,  
Bon Homme Richard (CVA 31) and Oriskany (CVA 34), were deleted from the  
Navy's rolls in 1989.  
MODERNISATION : Modernised under several programmes to increase ability to  


operate more advanced aircraft. Have angled flight deck. Three elevators  
fitted; `Pointed' centreline lift forward between catapults, deck-edge lift  
on port side at leading edge of angled deck, and deck-edge lift on  
starboard side aft of island structure. Two C-11 steam catapults.  
STRUCTURE     : Armour: As originally designed; 2.5-4 in side belt; 2.5-3 in  
hangar deck; 1.5 in flight deck and main deck.

PROGRAMMES    : New Jersey entered the Long Beach Naval shipyard on 1 October  
1981 and recommissioned on 28 December 1982. She began her first  
operational deployment in March 1983, was deployed off Central America and  
later, off Lebanon. Under original plans Iowa was to recommission on 14  
July 1984 but in December 1983 the need to relieve New Jersey in the  
Mediterranean caused a reprogramming and the date was advanced to 8 April  
1984. Missouri activated at Long Beach Naval Shipyard, was completed in  
April 1986 for commissioning on 10 May 1986. Wisconsin was towed from  
Philadelphia to Avondale Shipyards in New Orleans in the summer of 1986 for  
preparation for her modernisation, and later that year to Ingalls  
Shipbuilding in Pascagoula for its completion. She was recommissioned 22  
October 1988, and completed fitting out in February 1989.  
MODERNISATION : Reactivation plan included installation of the SLQ-32  
electronic warfare system; addition of an SPS-49 air search radar, complete  
modernisation of all other existing electronic and communications  


equipment; updating of accommodation; converting the ships to Navy  
distillate fuel; the removal of four twin 5 in/38 gun mounts, the fitting  
of eight quadruple Mk 143 Tomahawk cruise missile launchers; the  
installation of four quadruple Harpoon launch canisters; the addition of  
four Phalanx 20 mm CIWS mounts; reshaping of the fantail to accommodate the  
open storage of three helicopters (LAMPS 3) while leaving the helicopter  
pad vacant for the operation of a fourth; the modification of existing  
systems to meet current sewage and lighting standards. In addition, the  
ULQ- 6 system on the control tower is removed as well as the crane aft and  
the mainmast. A quadruple lattice mast is installed between number one  
funnel and the control tower to handle the radars and other electronic  
equipment. Israeli Aircraft Industries RPV drone used successfully by Iowa  
for surveillance and is now fitted in all. Only one aircraft can be  
operated at a time but four can be stowed on deck.  
STRUCTURE     : The main armour belt consists of Class A steel armour 12.1 in  
thick tapering vertically to 1.62 in; a lower armour belt aft of Turret No.  
3 to protect propeller shafts is 13.5 in; turret faces are 17 in; turret  
tops are 7.25 in; turret backs are 9.5 in; barbettes have a maximum of 17.3  
in of armour; second deck armour is 6 in; and the three-level conning  
tower sides are 17.5 in with an armoured roof 7.25 in (the conning tower  
levels are pilot house navigation bridge and flag-signal bridge).  
OPERATIONAL   : On 19 April 1989, an explosion in Iowa`s 16 in B gun turret  
caused the death of 47 officers and men. Although the cause of the  
explosion is uncertain, the most likely explanation, according to the Naval  
investigation report, is that a detonating device had been placed between  
powder bags in the gun's magazine. Plans to repair the turret were deferred  
when the decision was made that Iowa and New Jersey would be `mothballed'  
in FY 1991 as a money-saving measure. This will leave one battleship in  
each of the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets. Their deactivation is not,  
however, expected to alter the Navy's strategic homeporting programme,  
which called for Iowa to be based with other ships at Staten Island, New  
York, Wisconsin at Corpus Christi, Texas, New Jersey at Long Beach,  
California, and Missouri ultimately at Pearl Harbor.

PROGRAMMES    : Long Beach was the first ship to be designed as a cruiser for  
the USA since the end of the Second World War. She is the world's first  
nuclear-powered surface warship and the first warship to have a guided  
missile main battery. Authorised in FY 1957 and first got underway on  
nuclear power on 5 July 1961. Ordered as a guided missile light cruiser  
(CLGN 160) reclassified as a guided missile cruiser (CGN 160) early in 1957  
and renumbered (CGN 9) on 1 July 1957. The original plan was to install  
Polaris missiles.  
MODERNISATION : As a result of the 1976 cancellation of the planned fitting  


of AEGIS Long Beach underwent a mid-life modernisation 1980-83. This  
included updating of missile systems, restoration of the missile radars,  
the SPS 32 and 33 air search replaced by SPS 48 and 49 systems, replacement  
of the ship's computer and modernisation of the communications system.  
Tomahawk box launchers have since been added and the New Threat Update  
modernisation is planned to be done by FY 1995; this includes SPS 48E radar  
and updating SPG 55D radars and the Mk 10 launchers, and fitting SYS 2(V)2  
IADT.  
STRUCTURE     : Initially planned at about 7800 tons (standard) to test the  
feasibility of a nuclear-powered surface warship. Early in 1956 her  
displacement was increased to 11000 tons and a second SAM missile  
launcher was added. A Talos missile launcher (now removed) was also added  
which, with other features, further increased the displacement.

MODERNISATION : Beginning in FY 1980 it was planned to give ships of this  
class a mid-life modernisation, officially known as `DDG upgrade'. This was  
to include installation of the Harpoon SSM/Standard ARM missile system,  
radar receivers in the CIC with UYA 4 consoles for real-time tactical data  
processing, and fitting two SQQ 23 sonar domes with control units. A  
limited modernisation in DDG 19, 20 and 22 during two overhauls using  
`Fleet Maintenance' funds was completed in 1985 and others of the class  
have been given some of the modifications since then.  
STRUCTURE     : These ships were built to an improved Forrest Sherman class  
design with aluminium superstructures. DDG 20-24 have stem anchors because  
of sonar arrangement. Several ships have been modified with an extension of  
the bridge structure on the starboard side on the 02 level.  
OPERATIONAL   : Seven had paid off by May 1990, one more goes in August 1990  
and eight more in FY 1991.  
Sales: Three to Australia and three to West Germany; all new  
constructions. Others may be sold as they pay off.

PROGRAMMES    : First 10 ships authorised as DE 1052-1061 in FY 1964. Gray (FF  
1054), Lang (FF 1060), Miller (FF 1091) and Valdez (FF 1096) assigned to  
Naval Reserve Forces FY 1982. These were the first modern combatants so  
assigned. Patterson  (FF 1061) and Blakely (FF 1072) followed in 1983,  
Roark (FF 1053) in June 1986, Meyerkord (FF 1058) in September 1988, and  
Hepburn and Cook in FY 1990. Sims and Ainsworth are scheduled to transfer  
later in FY 1990. Originally classified as ocean escorts (DE), reclassified  


as frigates (FF) on 30 June 1975. Six more will transfer to the NRF in FY  
1991 unless required for drug interdiction assignments.  
MODERNISATION : Designed to operate the now-discarded DASH unmanned  
helicopter. From FY 1972 to FY 1976 they were modified to accommodate the  
Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) and the SH-2F Seasprite  
anti-submarine helicopter; hangar and flight deck are enlarged. In 1979 a  
programme was initiated to fit 3.5 ft bow bulwarks and spray strakes to all  
ships of the class adding 9.1 tons to the displacement. Sea Sparrow SAM  
replaced by Phalanx 1982-88.  
 After much pressure from Congress it seems probable that a SLEP  
modernisation programme will be put in hand. This might include upgrading  
sonar and ASW capability as the major part of the package, but a second  
Phalanx, improved EW to SLQ 32(V)3 standard, updating the Mk 68 GFCS and  
new communications are all possible. The Navy has no plans to replace the  
propulsion plant.  
STRUCTURE     : Improved ASROC-torpedo reloading capability (note slanting face  
of bridge structure immediately behind ASROC). Four Mk 32 torpedo tubes are  
fixed in the midships structure, two to a side, angled out at 45 degrees.  
The arrangement provides improved loading capability over exposed triple Mk  
32 torpedo tubes. A 4000 lb lightweight anchor is fitted on the port side  
and an 8000 lb anchor fits into the after section of the sonar dome.

support: AH-1W Super Cobra, CH-53E Super Stallion, CH-53D Sea Stallion,  
U/CH-46E Sea Knight, UH-1N Twin Huey, AH-1T Sea Cobra, and SH-60B Seahawk  
helicopters.  
  
PROGRAMMES    : This class will be the cornerstone of the Navy's amphibious  


forces for many years to come; however, it remains to be seen whether the  
Department of Defense will concur in the Marine Corps' goal of 10, or  
whether Congress will fund that number. Five are to meet lift requirements  
by the mid-1990s. $761 million was included in the FY 1989 budget for the  
fourth ship of the class, construction of which is scheduled to begin in  
June 1990, and $971 million is being sought in FY 1991 for the fifth  
ship.  
STRUCTURE     : Two aircraft elevators, one to starboard and aft of the  
`island' and one to port amidships. The well deck is 50 ft (15.2 m) wide  
and can accommodate up to three Amphibious Air-Cushion Vehicles (LCAC). The  
flight deck has nine helicopter landing spots. Cargo capacity is 101000  
cu ft total with an additional 20000 sq ft to accommodate vehicles. The  
bridge is two decks lower than that of an LHA, command, control and  
communication spaces having been moved inside the hull to avoid `cheap  
kill' damage. Fitted with a 600-bed capacity hospital and six operating  
rooms. HY-100 steel covers the flight deck.  
OPERATIONAL   : A typical complement of aircraft would be a mix of 30  
helicopters and six to eight Harriers (AV-8B). In the secondary role as a  
sea control ship the most likely mix is 20 AV-8B Harriers and four to six  
SH-60B Seahawk helicopters.

authorised in FY 1969, LHA 2 and LHA 3 in FY 1970 and LHA 4 and LHA 5 in FY  


1971.  
STRUCTURE     : Beneath the full-length flight deck are two half-length hangar  
decks, the two being connected by an elevator amidships on the port side  
and a stern lift; beneath the after elevator is a floodable docking well  
measuring 268 ft in length and 78 ft in width which is capable of  
accommodating four LCU 1610 type landing craft. Also included is a large  
garage for trucks and AFVs and troop berthing for a reinforced battalion.  
33730 sq ft available for vehicles and 116900 cu ft for palletted  
stores. Extensive medical facilities including operating rooms, X-ray room,  
hospital ward, isolation ward, laboratories, pharmacy, dental operating  
room and medical store rooms.  
OPERATIONAL   : The flight deck can operate a maximum of nine CH-53D Sea  
Stallion or 12 CH-46D/E Sea Knight helicopters or a mix of these and other  
helicopters. With some additional modifications, ships of this class can  
effectively operate AV-8B aircraft. The normal mix of aircraft allows for  
six AV-8Bs. The optimum aircraft configuration for this class is dependent  
upon assigned missions. Unmanned Reconnaissance Vehicles (UAVs) can be  
operated.

1971 and began operations in January 1972 as an interim sea control ship;  
she reverted to the amphibious role in 1974 but kept 12 AV-8As on board.  
All seven will be replaced by the Wasp class in due course.  
STRUCTURE     : Iwo Jima was the world's first ship designed specifically to  
operate helicopters. Two deck-edge lifts, one to port opposite the bridge  
and one to starboard aft of island. Full hangars are provided; no arresting  
wires or catapults. Two small elevators carry cargo from holds to flight  
deck. Stowage of 4300 sq ft for vehicles and 37400 cu ft for palletted  
stores. Fitted with extensive medical facilities including operating room,  
X-ray room, hospital ward, isolation ward, laboratory, pharmacy, dental  
operating room, and medical store rooms.  
OPERATIONAL   : The flight decks provide for simultaneous take off or landing  
of seven CH-46 Sea Knight or four CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters during  
normal operations. Can operate AV-8Bs following modifications to refine  
day/night capability. Each LPH can carry a Marine battalion landing team,  
its guns, vehicles, and equipment, plus a reinforced squadron of transport  
helicopters and various support personnel. All have been used on many  
occasions as platforms for airborne minesweeping operations.

reversed on 1 October 1982 when Durham and El Paso returned to active  
status followed by Charleston on 18 February 1983 and Mobile on 30  
September 1983. Originally designated Attack Cargo Ship (AKA), Charleston  
redesignated Amphibious Cargo Ship (LKA) on 14 December 1968; others to LKA  
on 1 January 1969.  
STRUCTURE     : Designed specifically for the attack cargo ship role for  
amphibious operations. Design includes two heavy-lift cranes with a 78.4  
ton capacity, two 40 ton capacity booms, and eight 15 ton capacity booms.  
These are among the first US Navy ships with a fully automated main  
propulsion plant. Control of plant is from bridge or central machinery  
space console. This automation permitted a 45 man reduction in complement.
