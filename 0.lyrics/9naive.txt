I'm not saying it's your fault
Although you could have done more
Oh you're so naive yet so
How could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart?
Oh and your sweet and pretty face
In such an ugly world
Something so beautiful
Oh that every time I look inside

I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be
Well, she's still out to get me
And I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be.
She's still out to get me
